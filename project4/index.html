        <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-tennis-ball"></i> Essential Tennis Gear</h2>
        <p>Tennis equipment plays a big role in the game, influencing a player's performance and comfort on the court.
            Of course, the most important piece is the racket. Rackets come in many sizes, weights, and string patterns
            to suit different play styles. A bigger head size means the racket will be more forgiving when missing the
            sweet spot (the middle) of the racket. The heavier the racket, the more stable it will be when contacting
            the ball. Don't be fooled by a couple of grams because even 5g will have a huge change in the feel. Tighter
            string patterns, such as 18 by 20, have more control but will produce less spin compared to 16 by 19. Proper
            footwear is also important. Tennis shoes provide the proper grip and support for the quick movements needed
            in tennis. However, some shoes are meant to be used on different court surfaces..</p>
